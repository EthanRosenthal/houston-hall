        We've lived in New York for a while now (~7 years) but still find
        new things to do all the time. Below is a list
        of some of our favorite things to do, food to eat, and drinks
        to drink in the city that never sleeps. If you're going to come to NY,
        you might as well make a weekend out of it!
        </p>

				<h2>
					Restaurants
				</h2>
				<h4><a href="http://www.rubyscafe.com/" target="_blank">Ruby's</a></h4>
				<p>
					<i>219 Mulberry Street</i><br>
					Australian restaurant in the heart of Nolita serving one of our favorite burgers. We recommend the Bronte. Lively atmosphere, perfect for celebrity sightings - who knows, you may even run into Zachary Quinto.
				</p>
				<h4><a href="http://www.artichokepizza.com/" target="_blank">Artichoke Pizza</a></h4>
				<p>
					<i>111 Macdougal Street</i><br>
					Awesome pizza place in the West Village. Grab a classic New York slice or go for the decadent artichoke slice (but check with your cardiologist first).

				<p>
					<i>166 West 4th Street</i><br>
					Small, low-key, underground taco place in the West Village. After a few tacos, head across the street to Four-Faced Liar for some brews.

        <h4>The High Line</h4>

        <h4>Union Square</h4>
				<p>
          A popular farmers market, Hare Krishnas, protests, chess players, and a dog park - what's not to love?
        </p>
        <h4>Washington Square Park</h4>
				<p>
          Welcoming you with a beautiful arch, this park is liveliest at night teeming with musicians, artists, skateboarders, and pigeon men.
