        We've lived in New York for a while now (~7 years) but still find
        new things to do all the time. As the wedding nears, we'll fill in the
        list below of some of our favorite things to do, food to eat, and drinks
        to drink in the city that never sleeps. If you're going to come to NY,
        you might as well make a weekend out of it!
