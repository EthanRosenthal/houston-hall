				<h2>Getting to Houston Hall</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.houstonhallny.com/" target="_blank">Houston Hall</a> is a beergarden located in Manhattan's West Village neighborhood.
					We do not suggest driving your own car as there is no guaranteed parking.
				  Thankfully, NYC has (<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/02/mta-one-day-625-delays.html" target="_blank">sometimes</a>) excellent public transportation and cabs!
				</p>
				<p>
					If you do insist on driving, there is a 24 Hour parking garage about 2 blocks west at 375 Hudson St. Strangely, the entrance to the garage
				  is actually located on King St between Hudson St and Greenwich St
				</p>
				<p><b>Address</b>: 222 W Houston St New York, NY 10014</p>

				<h3>By Subway</h3>
				<p>Houston Hall is right next to the Houston St. <b>1</b> train stop. Upon leaving the station, walk east down Houston St, and Houston Hall is midway down the block on the left.</p>
				<p>Alternatively, the West 4 St. Station is a 6 minute walk away and serves the <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, and <b>M</b> lines.
				  Upon leaving the West 4 St. Station, walk south down 6th Avenue, and then hang a right on Houston St. Houston Hall will be midway down the block on the right.</p>
				<h3>By Taxi</h3>
				<p>Just tell the cab driver that you're going to Houston and Varick Street, and you should be good to go!</p>
				<h3>By PATH</h3>
				<p>
				If you are staying across the river in New Jersey, then you can take the 33rd St PATH train to Christopher St, and
				Houston Hall is a 9 minute walk south from the station.
