				<p>We have blocked off rooms in a number of hotels near the wedding venue.
				We chose these hotels because they cover a range of room rates while still
			  being close to the wedding venue. It should be noted that there are
			  <i>many, many</i> other hotels in the city to choose from if one wants
			  to trade distance for cost.</p>

				<p>As an alternative to staying in a Manhattan hotel, one could book a
				cheaper hotel in Jersey City and take the PATH train accross
			  the river to the Christopher St. PATH station which is within walking
			  distance to the wedding venue.</p>
