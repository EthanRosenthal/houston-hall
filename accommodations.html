				<p>We have blocked off rooms in a number of hotels near the wedding venue.
				We chose these hotels because they cover a range of room rates while still
			  being close to the wedding venue. It should be noted that there are
			  many, many other hotels (and Airbnb's) in the city to choose from if one wants
			  to trade distance for cost.</p>

				<p>As an alternative to staying in a Manhattan hotel, one could book a
				cheaper hotel in Jersey City and take the PATH train accross
			  the river to the Christopher St. PATH station which is within walking
			  distance to the wedding venue.</p>
